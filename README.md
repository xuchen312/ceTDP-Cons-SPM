# ceTDP-Cons-SPM

**ceTDP-Cons-SPM** is an SPM extension for estimating true discovery proportion (TDP) using the **ceTDP** approach, which is a more informative cluster inference approach that builds upon cluster extent thresholding with Gaussian random field theory, implemented in SPM.

## Introduction

Cluster extent inference is one of the most popular approaches for detecting activations in fMRI. Although being powerful in general, this approach suffers from the so-called spatial specificity paradox. That is, each significant cluster contains at least one active voxel, but the location or amount of signal is unknown. The new method **ceTDP** (Goeman et al., 2023) complements and improves upon the current RFT-based cluster extent inference by quantifying the signal with a TDP estimate for every region.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Please download and install Matlab. For macOS users, you could edit the ```.bash_profile``` file and add Matlab to the ```PATH``` by appending
  ``` r
  export PATH=/Applications/MATLAB_***.app/bin:$PATH
  ```
  where the installed Matlab version ```MATLAB_***``` can be found by running ```matlabroot``` in Matlab.

* Please download SPM12 and add it to the Matlab search path. You could follow either
  
  + **HOME -> Set Path -> Add Folder...**
  
  + Run the following line in Matlab
    ``` r
    addpath(genpath('.../spm12'));
    ```
  
### Installing ClusterTDP-SPM

* Please download the latest version of ClusterTDP-SPM with
  ``` r
  git clone https://github.com/xuchen312/ClusterTDP-SPM.git
  ```

* Please add the folder for the ClusterTDP-SPM toolbox to the Matlab search path by following either
  
  + **HOME -> Set Path -> Add Folder...**
  
  + Run the below script from Matlab console
    ```r
    addpath(genpath('.../ClusterTDP-SPM'))
    ```
    
## **Syntax**:
  ```matlab
  [hReg,xSPM,SPM,TabDat] = spm_clusterTDP([xSPM,file])
  ```
- **Inputs** (*optional*)
  - ```xSPM``` Thresholded SPM structure,
  - ```file``` Character string specifying a filename (for CSV export).
  
- **Outputs** (*optional; must use none or all for interactive exploration*)
  - ```hReg``` Handle to the results GUI,
  - ```xSPM``` Thresholded SPM structure,
  - ```SPM``` Standard SPM structure,
  - ```TabDat``` Result summary table structure.

## Implementation

* Navigate to the folder for the ClusterTDP-SPM toolbox with
  ```r
  cd .../ClusterTDP-SPM
  ```
  
* Launch Matlab, or execute Matlab from the Terminal (command prompt) without the full desktop GUI while still allowing to display graphs with the command
  ```r
  matlab -nodesktop -nosplash
  ```
  
* Conduct the ClusterTDP inference by running the function ```spm_clusterTDP``` with at most two input arguments in the console, using either
  
  + ```spm_clusterTDP``` to interactively query ```SPM``` and select the desired cluster thresholding options on the pop-up GUI interface
    
  + ```spm_clusterTDP(xSPM)``` if an input ```xSPM``` structure is already loaded into the workspace or could be loaded using ```load()``` function
    
  + ```spm_clusterTDP(file)``` if you would like to write the result summary table to a CSV file named, e.g., ```ClusTab.csv```
    
  + ```spm_clusterTDP(xSPM, file)``` if ```xSPM``` is available and the output CSV file name ```file``` is specified

  Please note the input argument ```xSPM``` should have the input structure detailed in ```spm_getSPM.m```. In addition, some outputs of the ClusterTDP inference can be returned for interactive exploration of the results in the control panel with, e.g.,
  ```r
  [hReg,xSPM,SPM,TabDat] = spm_clusterTDP;
  ```

* Alternatively, the above steps could be executed from the Terminal (command prompt) and quit Matlab in the end with, e.g.,
  ```r
  matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "cd('.../ClusterTDP-SPM'); spm_clusterTDP; exit"
  ```

## Result Display

The main **ClusterTDP-SPM** results are summarised with a result table ```TabDat``` that can be visualised from the graphics window in SPM, returned to the workspace, and exported to a CSV file. An example of such summary tables is as below.

Here, this summary table is highly related to the SPM12 statistics results table, and the summary variable ```TDP(lb)``` shows the lower bound of TDP bound, derived using ClusterTDP, for each significant cluster based on cluster extent inference.
